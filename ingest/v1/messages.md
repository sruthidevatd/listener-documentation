This endpoint is designed to accept multiple messages, split them into individual messages, and pass them through Listener. Outside of splitting the messages, no transformation occurs. Call this endpoint to send multiple message at once instead of individual messages.

If the request payload is a JSON array[^1], it will be parsed and each entity of the array will be treated as an individual message in Listener.  If the payload is *not* a JSON array, a `Delimiter` header must be sent to indicate which character should be used to split the payload into messages.

### Definition

```http
POST https://listener-ingest-services.teradata.com/v1/messages HTTP/1.1
Authorization: token SOURCE_SECRET_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
Delimiter: |
Sync: 1
```

Header        | Required | Sample Value       | Purpose
------        | -------- | ------------       | -------
Authorization | Required | `fhwb-afwfa-wefaf` | Source secret key that determines to which source the data is sent.
Delimiter     | Optional | `,`                | Instructs Ingest to split the request body into multiple messages by a delimiter character. Can be any character except these: `\/"''`. Ignored if `Content-Type` is JSON.
Content-Type  | Optional | `application/json` | Content type of the request body. If `application/json`, Ingest will parse an array into multiple messages.
Sync          | Optional | `1`                | Request a UUID from Ingest to ensure Kafka accepted the message. Value must be 1, or will be treated as async.
