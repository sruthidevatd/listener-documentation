Targets are the entities that process a stream from a source and manage how that data is persisted to a system. They have an attached entity called a "writer," which does the actual work for pulling data from Listener and storing it in the system.

The properties *target_id*, *created_at*, *created_by*, *updated_at*, and *updated_by* are assigned by the Teradata Listener API at the moment of creation and are __Read-Only__.

The properties *owner*, *sample_size*, and *state* are assigned by the Teradata Listener API at the moment of creation.

The property *secret* is assigned by the Teradata Listener API at the moment of creation and is __Read-Only__ and only visible to *owner*.

The property *production* is governed by TBD and is __Read-Only__.

The property *state* can be changed only by deleting an item.

The property *dead\_letter\_queue* is __Read-Only__ and automatically populated if a target is configured with a *use\_dead\_letter\_queue* value of *true*.

## Target Mapping

Targets that support a database column structure can map fields from Listener to specific columns. All targets, except HDFS types, support mapping fields.

The mapping of data to columns can take one of two forms

1. Passthrough mapping
2. Shredding mapping

### Passthrough Mapping

Listener wraps messages with additional metadata that you can map and store in your target. The following four fields can be mapped:

Field     | Contents
-----     | --------
data      | Field with the raw data sent to Ingest.
source_id | ID for the source to which the packet was sent.
time      | Time the packet was ingested.
uuid      | UUID that gets assigned to the packet upon arrival.

Suppose there is a table with the following columns and associated names and types. Because the purpose of mapping is to allow you to link a particular field from above into a particular column, these could be named anything.

Column    | Type
------    | ----
records   | json
stream    | varchar
timestamp | timestamp
id        | varchar

The `data_map.mapping` array takes an object with three properties, `column`, `field`, and `type`. All three must be specified to validate. If you do not want to map a particular field, leave the object out of the array. Using the fields and the columns above, mapping would be defined in a target like the following example.

```json
{
  "data_map": {
    "mapping": [
      {
        "column": "records",
        "field": "data",
        "type": "json"
      }, {
        "column": "stream",
        "field": "source_id",
        "type": "varchar"
      }, {
        "column": "timestamp",
        "field": "time",
        "type": "timestamp"
      }, {
        "column": "id",
        "field": "uuid",
        "type": "varchar"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Shredding Mapping

Listener ingests `JSON` data, the nature of `JSON` data allows for easy parsing and the potential to map from `JSON` field names to database columns. This functionality is exposed in Listener through the `data_map.mapping_type`.

```json
{
  "data_map": {
    "mapping_type" : "auto_shred"
  }
}
```

If a target is configured with `auto_shred` and a user provides the following `JSON`

```json
{
  "country" : "France",
  "population" : 66991000,
  "famous_for" : ["Wine", "Cheese"],
  "religions" : {
    "Christian" : 63,
	"None" : 25,
	"Muslim" : 9,
	"Other" : 3,
  },
  "monarch" : null
}
```

The writer process will parse the provided JSON and make the following fields and values available for binding to the target database table.

Field        | Type        | Contents
-----        | ----        | ----
country      | Parsed      | "France"
population   | Parsed      | 66991000
famous\_for  | Parsed      | "[\"Wine\",\"Cheese\"]"
religions    | Parsed      | "{\"Christian\": 63, \"None\": 25, \"Muslim\": 9, \"Other\": 3}"
monarch      | Parsed      | null
data         | Listener    | Field with the raw data sent to Ingest.
source_id    | Listener    | ID for the source to which the packet was sent.
time         | Listener    | Time the packet was ingested.
uuid         | Listener    | UUID that gets assigned to the packet upon arrival.

The binding of values happens by examining the name of each column in the database table and finding the corresponding ```JSON``` field by comparing names. For example

Table Column  | Value                       | Explanation
---           | ---                         | ---
COUNTRY       | France                      | Matches `country` field through case insensitive comparison
UUID          | UUID associated with packet | Matches `uuid` field through case insensitive comparison
timezone      | null                        | No value in fields so defaults to null

## Target Types

Listener supports five types of targets. These targets have slightly different configuration options.

* [Teradata](#teradata)
* [Aster](#aster)
* [HDFS](#hdfs)
* [HBase](#hbase)
* [Websocket](#websocket)

#### Teradata

A Teradata target requires a `schema` and `table` in the `data_path`, as well as a `username` and `password` in the `system_info`.

```json
{
  "target_type": "teradata",
  "data_path": {
    "schema": "schema",
    "table": "table"
  },
  "data_map": {
    "mapping": [
      {
        "column": "db_column_name",
        "field": "data",
        "type": "json"
      }
    ]
  },
  "system_info": {
    "username": "ip112233",
    "password": "password"
  }
}
```

#### Aster

An Aster target requires a `schema` and `table` in the `data_path`, as well as a `username` and `password` in the `system_info`.

```json
{
  "target_type": "aster",
  "data_path": {
    "schema": "schema",
    "table": "table"
  },
  "data_map": {
    "mapping": [
      {
        "column": "db_column_name",
        "field": "data",
        "type": "json"
      }
    ]
  },
  "system_info": {
    "username": "ip112233",
    "password": "password"
  }
}
```

#### HDFS

An HDFS target requires a `path` and `extension` in the `data_path`, as well as a `username` and `password` in the `system_info`. Currently, only sequence files are supported, therefore, the extension `extension` must be `seq`.

```json
{
  "target_type": "hdfs",
  "data_path": {
    "path": "/data/listener/",
    "extension": "seq"
  },
  "properties": {
    "webhcat_table": "listener"
  },
  "system_info": {
    "username": "ip112233",
    "password": "password"
  }
}
```

#### HBase

A HBase target requires a `schema` (also referred to as a column family) and `table` in the `data_path`, as well as a `username` and `password` in the `system_info`.

```json
{
  "target_type": "hbase",
  "data_path": {
    "schema": "schema",
    "table": "table"
  },
  "data_map": {
    "mapping": [
      {
        "column": "db_column_name",
        "field": "data",
        "type": "json"
      }
    ]
  },
  "system_info": {
    "username": "ip112233",
    "password": "password"
  }
}
```

#### Websocket

The websocket type target will create a websocket server that allows the user to connect third party apps or custom logic
to a source in listener.

A websocket target simply requires a `source_id` and `name`.

```json
{
  "target_type": "websocket",
  "source_id": "84757abc-ba43-5736-0ba3-1bdac4748290",
	"name": "my websocket"
}
```

The elements returned when a websocket target is created will provide client connection details back to the user:

```json
{
	"data_path": {
		"secret": "ffafef69-43cf-44b8-a3c4-80a93808ac4f",
		"url": "https://listener-streamer-services-myenv.example.com/v1/streamer/e5925443-ec1c-4fd4-ada8-8d8c6c603cee",
		"websocket": "wss://listener-streamer-services-myenv.example.com/v1/streamer/e5925443-ec1c-4fd4-ada8-8d8c6c603cee"
	},
	"name": "my websocket",
	"source_id": "96bcaa82-6091-4e96-aee5-cc3fe2015bae",
	"target_id": "e5925443-ec1c-4fd4-ada8-8d8c6c603cee",
	"target_type": "websocket"
}
```

In order to connect to a websocket, you must send a websocket handshake request to the returned URL with the correct authorization header-

```
GET https://listener-streamer-services-myenv.example.com/v1/streamer/e5925443-ec1c-4fd4-ada8-8d8c6c603cee
Authorization: token ffafef69-43cf-44b8-a3c4-80a93808ac4f
```

A successful response means that you can then connect to the secure websocket at

```
wss://listener-streamer-services-myenv.example.com/v1/streamer/e5925443-ec1c-4fd4-ada8-8d8c6c603cee
```

## Get Target Status

A target's status is the current status of the writer, which can be one of four states: `started`, `starting`, `paused`, or `pausing`. Due to a writer taking some time to deploy, the `starting` and `pausing` statuses indicate the writer is changing state.
