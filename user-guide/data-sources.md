The **Data Sources** card shows a list of all sources for all owners. From **Data Sources**, you can perform the following tasks:

- Filter the list of sources
- View source details
- Unstar and star sources
- Create a source

## Viewing the List of All Data Sources

1. In the user navigation panel, click **Data Sources**.
2. [Optional] To view the complete source name, if truncated, mouse over the visible part of the name.

## Filters

You can filter **Data Sources** by **Locked Status**, source name, or time period.

### Locked Status
* **All**: Lists all sources, regardless of **Locked Status**
* **Locked**: Lists only sources with locked targets
* **Unlocked**: Lists only sources without locked targets

### Search by name

Lists sources that match the name entry.

### 1H, 1D, 7D, 1M

Activity for all or filtered sources for one of the following time periods:
- **1H**: 1 Hour
- **1D**: 1 Day
- **7D**: 7 Days
- **1M**: 1 Month

## Filtering Sources

1. [Optional] Do any of the following:
 * To filter by **Locked Status**, click **Locked** or **Unlocked**.
 * To filter by source name, enter any part of a source name in the **Search by name box**. To clear this filter, delete the entry.
 * To filter by a different time period, click **1H**, **1D**, **7D**, or **1M**.

## Viewing Source Details
1. Click the name of the source. Listener displays source details, including a description, source owners, API key, and target information. 

The source details view also includes Broadcast Streams. For information about creating Broadcast Streams to connect source data to external apps, see [Broadcast Streams](broadcast-streams.md).

## Starred and Unstarred Sources

When you create a source, Listener automatically stars it, making it a favorite, and displays it in the **Source Activity** card on the **Dashboard**. You can unstar it and remove it from the **Dashboard** or star it again from the **Data Sources card**.

### Unstarring and Starring Sources

2. In the first column of the row that contains the source, click the star. One of the following occurs:
 * If you unstarred the source, the star color changes to gray. The source has been unstarred and will no longer appear on the **Dashboard**.
 * If you starred the source, the star color changes to orange. The source has been starred and will appear on the Dashboard.

## Creating a Source

Create sources from the **Data Sources** card, the **Dashboard**, or from **Manage Sources.** For more information, see [Create a Source](create-source.md).

For information about creating Broadcast Streams to connect source data to external apps, see [Broadcast Streams](broadcast-streams.md).

## About Locked Targets

If a lock appears next to a source name, the source has locked targets. If there is no lock next to a source name, the source has no locked targets. Only source owners can unlock a target to unlock the source.
