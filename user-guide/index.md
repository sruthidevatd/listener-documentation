Listener is a self-service solution for ingesting and distributing extremely fast-moving data streams in near real-time. Examples of data sources include clickstream data, log files, Twitter feeds, IoT data, and more. Listener can distribute the data to many systems, including Teradata, HDFS, Hbase, and Aster.

Listener continuously monitors incoming data streams, gathers metadata, and shows metrics for data flow over time, such as latency, number of records, and size of records. The Listener [Dashboard](dashboard.md) provides a visual representation of what is happening with your data pipelines, and provides options for managing sources, targets, systems, and more. 

Listener withstands service interruptions in target systems by buffering data until the system comes back online.  It shows you trends in data flow from sources, and detects variances that may indicate problems upstream.
